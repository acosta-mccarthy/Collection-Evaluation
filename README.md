# Collection-Evaluation
SQL query with Python code to trigger two different emails depending on the number of rows pulled.
The SQL query used here only looks for items with fiction call number in the bib and item.  Additional queries need to be written to look for items with different call numbers.
Python code includes a target number for the fiction collection.  Would need to be adjusted to custom fit the call number range.
